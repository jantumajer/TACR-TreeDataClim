**Tree-ring widths** : annual tree-ring widths measured per each tree stored in `rwl` <sup>Note</sup> format

**Climate** : timeseries of monthly mean temperatures and monthly precipitation totals stored in `csv` (alt. `xls`, `xlsx`) formats

<sup>Note</sup> The `rwl` is standard format for storing tree-ring width data used by dendrochronological comunity. For details about this and other types of dendrochronological formats, see https://www.treeringsociety.org/resources/SOM/Brewer_Murphy_SupplementaryMaterial.pdf
