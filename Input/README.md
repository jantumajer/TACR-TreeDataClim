**Metadata** : site metadata; mandatory columns include site name, coordinates, species, and link to *.rwl file with tree-ring width data of individual trees; format of the metadata file is `csv`

<sup>Note</sup> The `rwl` is standard format for storing tree-ring width data used by dendrochronological comunity. For details about this and other types of dendrochronological formats, see [here] (https://www.treeringsociety.org/resources/SOM/Brewer_Murphy_SupplementaryMaterial.pdf)
